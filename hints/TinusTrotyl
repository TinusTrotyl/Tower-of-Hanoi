        I donâ€™t know how to solve that mission.

    <div class="answer">
        <p>There are 3 pile:</p>
        <p>    let's call the one we want to place from the source, </p>
        <p>    the one we want to place to we call the target and </p>
        <p>    the one that's left then is the aux (from auxiliary). </p>
        <p>
           Now, if we want to move a pile of N disks from 1 (source) to 3 (target), then we first place
           N - 1 disks from souce to the aux (2), then move the bottem one to from source to target and
           then place all disks from aux to target.
        </p>

        Ok, we may move one disk at a time, how do we move a whole pile then? Sounds a bit confusing.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
           Just like I said before, place N - 1 disks to the pin you don't need (aux), the botem one to the target
           and then the rest from the aux to the target. And so on and so on . . . .

        Aha, now I see, every time the next whole pile is N - 1 disks, then one disk smaller !
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
           Yes, go on like that till all disks are moved and your goal is reached!
           And remember this will always be the seqence : . . .
           1. > N - 1 disks from source to aux,
           2. > The bottem disk to the target
           3. > The N - 1 disks from aux to target . . .
