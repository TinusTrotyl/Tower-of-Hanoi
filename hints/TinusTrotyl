        I donâ€™t know how to solve that mission.

    <div class="answer">
        <p>There are 3 pile:</p>
        <p>    let's call the one we want to place from the source, </p>
        <p>    the one we want to place to we call the target and </p>
        <p>    the one that's left then is the aux (from auxiliary). </p>
        <p>
           Now, if we want to move a pile of N disks from 1 (source) to 3 (target), then we first place
           N - 1 disks from souce to the aux (2), then move the bottem one to from source to target and
           then place all disks from aux to target.

        Ok, we may move one disk at a time, but how do we move a whole pile? Sounds a bit confusing.

        <p>
           Just like I said before, place N - 1 disks to the pin you don't need (aux), the botem one to the target
           and then the rest from the aux to the target. And so on and so on . . . .

        Aha, now I see, every time ten the next whole pile is N - 1 disks, one disk smaller !
        Thus we can solve recursively ?

        <p>
           Yes, go on like that till all disks are moved and your goal is reached!
           To move N disks repeat these three steps:
           1. > yield from move N - 1 disks from source to aux,
           2. > yield the bottem disk when it moves from source to the target
           3. > yield from move N - 1 disks from aux to target . . .
         </p>
