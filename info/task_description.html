<p>
  There is a legend about a Hindu temple in the Indian city of Benares,
</p>

<p>
 whose priests, the Brahmins, are engaged in moving a tower of 64 gold disks.
</p>

<p>
  The discs lie on three diamond needles, a cubit long and as thick as the body of a bee.
</p>

<p>
  According to legend, the world comes to an end when the work is done.
</p>

<p>
  Assuming the priests move 1 checker per second, it'll take 2 ** 64 − 1, which is about 1.84×10 ** 19 seconds to complete the puzzle.
</p>

<p>
  This corresponds to roughly 585 billion years, about 43 times the estimated age of the universe.
</p>

<p>  
  The game was invented by the French mathematician Édouard Lucas in 1883.
</p>

<p>
 It is not clear whether Lucas invented this legend or was merely inspired by it.
