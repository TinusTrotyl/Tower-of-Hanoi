<h4><strong>
  Tower of Hanoi
</strong></h4>
<p>
  There is a legend about a Hindu temple in the Indian city of Benares,
  <br />whose priests, the Brahmins, are engaged in moving a tower of 64 gold
  disks.<br />
  The discs lie on three diamond needles, a cubit long and as thick as the body of a bee.
  <br />The object is to move the entire tower of discs to another needle,
  one disk at a time where<br />
  no larger disk may rest on a smaller one ever.
  <br />And then, according to legend, the world comes to an end when the work is done.
</p>
<p>
  Assuming the priests move 1 checker per second, it'll take 2 ** 64 &minus; 1,
  which is about 1.84&times;10 ** 19 seconds<br />to complete the task.
  This corresponds to roughly 585 billion years,<br />about 43 times the estimated age
  of the universe.
</p>
<p>
  The game was invented by the French mathematician &Eacute;douard Lucas in 1883.
  <br />It is not clear whether Lucas invented this legend or was merely inspired by it.
</p>
<p>
  The game consists of a board with three pins on it and a number of discs
  of different diameters,<br />each having a hole in the middle.
  <br />At the start of the game, a cone-shaped tower of a number of discs is placed on the
  first pin in such a way
  <br />that there is always a smaller disk on top of a larger disk,
  the other two pins stay empty.
  <br />The object of the game is now to move the entire tower of discs to the last pin,
  observing the following 2 rules:
</p>
<p>
  1. Only the top disk of any tower may be moved, one disk at a time.
  <br />
  2. A disk can be moved to any pin, but a larger disk never may rest on a smaller one.
</p>
<p>
  The 3 pins are numbered 1, 2 and 3.
  <br />
  Your task is to write a generator function (named hanoi)
  that takes the number of disks as input and from where and
  <br />
  to which pin a disk should be moved to move the entire tower from the first pin [1]
  to the last pin[3]
  <br />
  in as less moves as possible as an output.
</p>
<p>
  Input: The number of discs in play as an integer.
  <br />
  Output: A series tuples, containing two integers indicating from and to which pin
  a disk shall be moved to complete
  <br />
  the task in a minimum number of moves as a generator object.
</p>
<p>
  example: hanoi(2) generates (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)
